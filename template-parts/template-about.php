            <p class="about-text">Sure, you’ve been to a “haunted house” - but can you imagine the frightening
                possibilities of a haunted cornfield? Voted Tucson’s best haunted attraction for years, Tucson’s Terror
                In the Corn is Southern Arizona’s scariest and most unique Halloween event.
                <br>
                <br>
                Enjoy a variety of “haunts” and Halloween fun, all connected by a totally immersive and terrifying
                cornfield. When darkness falls
                and the moon comes out, so do the scares, screams and surrounding terror! The corn is calling…enter if
                you dare. 
                <br>
                <br>
