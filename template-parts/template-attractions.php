                    haunted
                    cornfield. Avoid the insane locals who lurk in the long grass. Escape the monsters of lore just
                    waiting to snatch their next victim. Keep away from the creatures that call the corn home. Enter
                    if
                    you dare, but remember…if you get lost in the Field of Screams, you may never make it out again!
